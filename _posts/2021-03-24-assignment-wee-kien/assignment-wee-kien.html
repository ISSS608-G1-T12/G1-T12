<p><p>Existing financial data websites such as Yahoo Finance do a good job in providing historical price data and technical indicators, but the beginner investor lacks the knowledge to properly utilise and benefit from these. In addition, we have also identified several gaps in such websites.</p>
<p>For one, these websites do not provide tools to allow the user to compare stocks meaningfully or zoom in to the statistical properties of financial returns. For example, a user is unable to conduct correlation analysis or visualize the distribution of returns. Secondly, these websites also do not provide any form of forecasting to aid in investors’ decisions.</p>

<h2 id="overview">1. Overview</h2>
<h3 id="background">1.1 Background</h3>
<p>Traditional financial data websites usually shy away from giving recommendations or advising users on investing decisions. While in depth studies are often conducted and used in academia or research, the outputs of these studies are often not accessible nor timely enough for the regular user. This means that these websites and their applications are limited in their use-cases. This can be due to issues arising from financial or legal liability if users act on the recommendations coming from these financial websites. As such we feel that this a gap between what is available publicly and user requirements.</p>
<h3 id="objective-motivation-and-literature-review">1.2 Objective/ Motivation and literature review</h3>
<p>This sub-module aims to provide rookie investors with tools to observe: a) The price action of various securities, b) Correlation of chosen stocks vs an underlying benchmark, and c) Portfolio performance over time.</p>
<p>The subsequent sections are mainly split into the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Charting and technical analysis</li>
<li>Correlation analysis between selected portfolio of stocks vs a benchmark index</li>
<li>Portfolio analysis:
<ul>
<li>Individual portfolio returns</li>
<li>Equity curve/ portfolio growth over time</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>LITERATURE REVIEW HERE</p>
<h3 id="charting-and-technical-analysis">1.3 Charting and Technical Analysis</h3>
<p>In this module, users are able to visualize the chosen stock symbol using a candlestick chart. Open, High, Low, and Close prices for the selected period are shown on the chart.</p>
<p>In addition, users are able to choose between 2 sets of technical indicators: Simple moving averages and Bollinger Bands.</p>
<p>Users are able to see the chosen symbol on 1 chart, and the accompanying benchmark index chosen on another chart.</p>
<p>Both charts are created in an interactive manner using the plotly package.</p>
<p>Finally, multiple features based on candlestick patterns are created and available through a table. Such candlestick patterns inform users of certain bullish or bearish price action patterns observed. This provides a different perspectives to users incline towards technical analysis.</p>
<h3 id="correlation-analysis">1.4 Correlation Analysis</h3>
<p>In this module, users are able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose 4 stock symbols and visualize their monthly adjusted prices</li>
<li>Visualize any anomalous points for these 4 stock symbols using an interactive chart</li>
<li>Visualize the 6 month rolling correlation between the 4 stock symbols, and the accompanying benchmark index</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="portfolio-analysis">1.5 Portfolio Analysis</h3>
<p>In this module, users are able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create 3 portfolios with different weightages for the 4 chosen stock symbols plus the accompanying benchmark index</li>
<li>Visualize the monthly returns (in %) for the 3 different portfolios on an interactive plot</li>
<li>Visualize an equity curve of the 3 portfolios, where users are able to choose the starting equity amount</li>
</ul>

<p>The following code chunk creates a clean candlestick chart without indicators for the selected stock ticker and benchmark index. To use the dygraphs package, the input data has to be transformed from tibble to xts (extensible time series) format. We use the tk_xts() function from the timetk package for this.</p>
<p>For charting, we use the dygraph package. We specify dyCandlestick() to create a candlestick chart, and dyRangeSelector() to allow users to have the ability to toggle the range on the charts. In addition, specifying the group = “charting” argument allows for synchronization between charts sharing the same argument value. Changes made to either affects both charts interactively.</p>

Figure 3: Candlestick graphs with bollinger bands indicators
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>When analysing candlestick charts, there are various patterns observable to those interested in technical analysis. Such patterns may inform a user if there is a bullish or a bearish short term trend observed. We are able to utilize the “CandleStickPattern” package developed by Ko Chiu Yu to create various extra features representing such candlestick patterns.</p>
<p>The following code chunk creates features for multiple candlestick patterns covered in the package. In each column, a value of 1 represents the presence of such a pattern in that current candlestick, while a 0 indicates the absence of such a pattern.</p>
<p>In addition, the final column “bull_bear_strength” represents a summation of all available candlestick pattern indicators. It ranges from -2 (extremely bearish) to 2 (extremely bullish), with 0 being neutral/ indecisiveness in the price action.</p>
<p>It may be useful to introduce such features into the final Shiny app. These features provides a different perspective for users inclined towards technical analysis for stocks, apart from the usual indicators such as moving averages or bollinger bands.</p>

Figure 4: Visualizing monthly stock prices for the portfolio of stocks
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the following code chunk, users are able to visualize anomalous points in the monthly stock prices for the 4 chosen stocks in a facet wrap for convenience. The plots are made interactive using the plotly package. While stocks in general may exhibit a volatile nature, such anomalous points in time may provide some indication of a turning point where stocks have been overbought or oversold in the short term.</p>

<p>Similar to the previous module, users will be able to specify the start and end dates for the period under analysis. In addition, they specify which the stock symbols for 4 stocks + 1 benchmark index. These stocks symbols will be used to form the portfolio for further analysis.</p>

<p>In the following code chunk, we specify the weights of portfolio 1, and visualize the monthly returns using plotly. We create a new field called gain_loss, where gains are visualized as green, while losses are visualized as red.</p>
<p>We further add a smoothing line (in blue) as an additional layer onto our graph. This allows us to quickly see a general trend of the portfolio across the period.</p>
